# trinitywarner-finalgame
This is the (Lab) Final Game that provides the code, documentation, and design document.

# 1) A summary of the project goals
My project goal was to just get something working, but unfortunately I could not even do that due to my poor management which always happens at the end of the semester- the most important time for it not to happen.
# 2) Instructions the player may need
You will need to click the “Flutter In” button to begin playing and “Flutter Away” to quit the game.
Once you begin to play, you should be able to see the description of the game.
You need to use your arrow keyboard keys to move the butterfly around and catch as many within the time-limit. 
You should see 3 different kinds of leaves there. 
# 3) A list of technologies and techniques you used
I used/tried the techniques of Weeks 11-12.
I also looked at the professor's own GitHub for more guidance.
# 4) Citations for any external resources you used

# 5) A description of your process:
#     a)  What did you learn?
I learned that I need to focus more on Python in general and work on my poor studying habits.
Since this topic in general takes a lot of time to fully understand!
I also learned I need to start emailing my professors and TAs when I am having trouble. 
Like my issue with Python telling me the module simpleGE wasn’t found and I didn’t know(still don’t) why.
#     b)  Where did you get stuck?
I guess you could say everything because I am not good with continuing my studying and management.
#     c)  What would you like to improve?
I would like to improve on studying simpleGE and pygame a lot more and hopefully be able to make bigger small games like everyone else!
I also want to be able to make 3 different kinds of leaves show up (if my game didn’t work).
#     d)  How would you do things differently next time?
Seek out more resources, not just what is given to us in class!
Do this everyday and practice to make the final game as I wanted it.
#     e)  How far did you stray from the game design document?
I think I was pretty close to following the document but I ended up wanting to add more things (to make it look more pretty).
I think because of this, I didn’t put too much focus on the actual coding.
#     f)  How did you stay on track?
I tried my best with planning it all out before I actually started the code and heavily referencing the Professors GitHub example.
Also deadlines.
I overlooked the deadline and thought I had a lot more time, this made me not stay on track correctly like I should have been!
